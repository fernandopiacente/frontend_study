# RESPONSIVE FRONTEND STUDY

A brief study of frontend development focusing on responsiveness, cross browsing and SEO, using HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

To minimize HTTP calls, it would be interesting to merge all the .css into a single file.

### Prerequisites

To run locally, the following scripts are needed:

modernizr.js <br>
mespond.js <br>
lightbox.js <br>
jquery <br>
prefixfree.js <br>
jquery.slides.min.js
